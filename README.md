# Sonic Pi 2 Competition for Schools 2014

Sonic Pi 2 is an open source programming environment designed to explore and teach programming concepts through the process of creating new sounds. 

The Sonic Pi Competition is designed to encourage eligible UK school students to use their creativity and coding knowledge to create a unique and original piece of music with Sonic Pi on a Raspberry Pi device. 

The theme for this competition is Space.

## Age Groups
The competition is open to all pupils attending a **UK school** aged between 7 - 16 years. Entries will be judged in the following three categories:
- KS2 Primary
- KS3 Middle School or Secondary
- KS4 Secondary 

## Submitting Entires
1. Entries must be an original piece of work created using Sonic Pi 2 on a Raspberry Pi.
1. There is a limit of 3 entries per school. If your school covers more than one age group please try to represent an even spread. You could perhaps hold an internal competition to select the best entries in the class or school.
1. Entries must include an audio file of what the music sounds like, the code used to create it, a short description and a cover art file.
1. The audio file must be no longer than **2 minutes** and the code should be no longer than **200 lines**, not including comments. (we are looking for short elequent code see example).
1. When you are ready to submit your entries, please return to the website to complete the [online entry form](). 
1. We must receive entries by 13th October 2014, no later than 11:59:59 PM (local time).
1. By submitting an entry you agree for it to be released under [the CC-BY-SA licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) and postentially hosted on our website. 

## Judging Criteria
All entries will be judged on:

1. How it sounds? We are looking for original and unique examples of music created with Sonic Pi in the first instance.
1. How elegant is the code? We will also take a look at the computing concepts and skills used to create the music. Here we are looking for efficent and a higher level of coding knowledge applied, depending on the key stage of submissions. Why use a long sequence of play and sleep when you can use a loop? 

## The Final
- The final will take place at the Cambridge Junction on 4th November as part of the Sonic Pi Live & Coding Summit.
- The final 12 will introduce and play their music on a Raspberry Pi to the audience in front of an expert panel of judges.
