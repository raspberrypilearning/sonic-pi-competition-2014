# Sonic Pi v2.0 Competition for Schools 2014

Sonic Pi v2.0 is an open-source programming environment designed to explore and teach programming concepts through the process of creating new sounds. 

The Sonic Pi Competition is designed to encourage eligible UK school students to use their creativity and coding knowledge to create a unique and original piece of music with Sonic Pi on a Raspberry Pi device. 

The theme for this competition is *Space Wonders*.

## Age Groups

The competition is open to all pupils attending a **UK school** aged between 7 - 16 years. Entries will be judged in the following three categories:

- KS2 Primary
- KS3 Middle School or Secondary
- KS4 Secondary 

## Submitting Entries

1. Entries must be an original piece of work created using [Sonic Pi v2.0](https://github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi) on a Raspberry Pi.
1. There is a limit of **3 entries per school**. If your school covers more than one age group please try to represent an even spread. You could perhaps hold an internal competition to select the best entries in the class or school.
1. Individuals and groups can enter. The maximum group size allowed is 5 members. 
1. Entries must include an **audio file** of what the music sounds like, the **code** used to create it, a **short written description**, and a **cover art** file.
1. The audio file must be no longer than **2 minutes** and the code should be no longer than **200 lines**, not including comments. (We are looking for short, elegant code).
1. The code must be executable on our office Raspberry Pi. It therefore needs to be only one file, only use the synths and samples available in Sonic Pi v2.0, and not require any overclocking.
1. When you are ready to submit your entries, please return to the website to complete the [online entry form](http://raspberrypi.org/competitions/sonic-pi/entry). 
1. We must receive entries by **13th October 2014**, no later than 11:59:59 PM (local time).
1. By submitting an entry you agree for it to be released under [the CC-BY-SA licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) and potentially hosted on our website. 

## Judging Criteria

All entries will be judged on:

1. **How it sounds**. We are looking for original and unique examples of music created with Sonic Pi in the first instance.
1. **How elegant the code is**. We will also take a look at the computing concepts and skills used to create the music. Here we are looking for efficiency and a higher level of coding knowledge applied, depending on the key stage of submissions. Why use a long sequence of `play` and `sleep` when you can use a loop? 

## The Final

- The final will take place at the Cambridge Junction on 4th November as part of the Sonic Pi Live & Coding Summit.
- The final 12 will introduce and play their music on a Raspberry Pi to the audience in front of an expert panel of judges.

## Prizes

- All entries will be put into a hat to win a Raspberry Pi and SD card at random.
- Semi-finalists will win a Sonic Pi half day workshop with Sam Aaron and [Juneau Projects](http://www.juneauprojects.co.uk/) for their school, and a custom Sonic Pi Pibow case. There will be 12 semi-finalists in total, 4 in each category.
- Overall winners in each category will win a Sonic Pi classroom kit containing 25 x Raspberry Pis and peripherals for their school and a minirig speaker, as well as a Sonic Pi Competition trophy designed by artists Juneau Projects. 


## Entry Deadline

We must receive entries by 13th October 2014, no later than 11:59:59 PM (local time)
