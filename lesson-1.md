# Lesson 1 - Sonic Pi Competition

## Introduction
>"To set foot on the soil of the asteroids, to lift by hand a rock from the Moon, to observe Mars from a distance of several tens of kilometers, to land on its satellite or even on its surface, what can be more fantastic?" Konstantin E. Tsiolkovsky, Father of Russian Astronautics, 1896.

Why are we fascinated by space? â€“ what is it about looking up and imaginging what is out there, that has spawned science fiction novels, films, poetry, art and music for hundreds of years? Space has been refered to as the final fontier.

Through these lessons, students will have the opportunity to investigate different types of music created to celebrate the wonders of Space. [2001 Space Odessey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrFVU3wQySs)

## Learning Objectives
- Investigate other artists interpreation of space as a theme for music.
- Explore and experiement with ideas and respond creatively to the competition theme of *Space Wonders*
- Be able to use some code in Sonic Pi on a Raspberry Pi to begin a 2 minute musical compesition on the theme.

## Learning Outcomes

### All students are able to:
- begin to produce a unique and original piece of music using code in Sonic Pi 2 on a Raspberry Pi which encapsulates their response to the theme of 'Space Wonders'.

### Most students are able to:
- describe how their unique music reflects the competition theme of *Space Wonders* and their creative journey.

### Some students are able to:
- analyse how effective their chosen coding techniques are in creating a piece of music and refine them to be more elequant.

## Main Development

## Plenary
Each group is invited to demonstrate the code they have written by executing it and playing the resulting music. This can be achieved by passing a speaker round to each group, and playing the music through the speaker rather than the headphones. Groups should introduce their composition explaining their creative journey with the remaining students asked to peer review, commenting constructively on what they thought worked well and why.

## Homework
Students should create a 'Cover' drawing, photograph, or picture to represent their song ready for next lesson.
