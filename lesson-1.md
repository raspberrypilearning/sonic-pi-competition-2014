# Lesson 1 - Sonic Pi Competition

## Introduction
>"To set foot on the soil of the asteroids, to lift by hand a rock from the Moon, to observe Mars from a distance of several tens of kilometers, to land on its satellite or even on its surface, what can be more fantastic?" Konstantin E. Tsiolkovsky, Father of Russian Astronautics, 1896.

Why are we fascinated by space? â€“ what is it about looking up and imaginging what is out there, that has spawned science fiction novels, films, poetry, art and music for hundreds of years? Space has been refered to as the final fontier.

Through these lessons, students will have the opportunity to investigate different types of music created to celebrate the wonders of Space. [2001 Space Odessey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrFVU3wQySs)
