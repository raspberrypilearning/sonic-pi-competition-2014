# Lesson 1 - Sonic Pi Competition

## Introduction

>"To set foot on the soil of the asteroids, to lift by hand a rock from the Moon, to observe Mars from a distance of several tens of kilometres, to land on its satellite or even on its surface, what can be more fantastic?" Konstantin E. Tsiolkovsky, Father of Russian Astronautics, 1896.

Why are we fascinated by space? What is it about looking up and imagining what is out there that has spawned science fiction novels, films, poetry, art, and music for hundreds of years? Space has been referred to as the final frontier.

Through these lessons, students will have the opportunity to investigate different types of music created to celebrate the wonders of space. 

## Learning Objectives

- Investigate other artists' interpretation of space as a theme for music.
- Explore and experiment with ideas, and respond creatively to the competition theme of *Space Wonders*.
- Be able to use some code in Sonic Pi on a Raspberry Pi to begin a 2 minute musical composition on the theme.

## Learning Outcomes

- Begin to produce a unique and original piece of music, using code in Sonic Pi v2.0 on a Raspberry Pi, which encapsulates their response to the theme of *Space Wonders*.
- Be able to describe how their unique music reflects the competition theme of *Space Wonders* and their creative journey.

## Lesson Summary

### Starter

Present the theme of *Space Wonders* to the students and ask them what comes to mind. Collect their answers on the board or as part of a spider diagram. Then play one or more songs from each subcategory below. Ask students what other words or ideas come to mind, and add them to the spider diagram. Then ask students to think about what instruments or sounds make up some of the music, for example trumpets or drums.

Introduce the Raspberry Pi Sonic Pi Competition to the students. Explain the brief to create a unique and original 2 minute musical composition, in order to win a prize. 

## Main Development

1. Split students into groups of no more than 5. Ask students in their groups to discuss their ideas for their music and start to write them down. They could undertake some research online for music that might help inspire them, if they have access to computers and the internet.
1. Ask students to set up their Raspberry Pis and log in using the default login `pi` and password `raspberry`. From the command line, students should next type `startx` to launch the graphical user interface. Finally, direct students to open Sonic Pi v2.0 from the desktop by double-clicking the icon.
1. If this is the first time students have used Sonic Pi v2.0 you may wish for them to work through [this worksheet](http://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/sonic-pi-2-taster/worksheet.md) to get them started or refreshed. 
1. More advanced users of Sonic Pi 2 may wish to work through [this second worksheet](http://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/sonic-pi-2-taster/worksheet-2.md) in order to unlock other techniques that can be used. 
1. Demonstrate some synths or samples in Sonic Pi that may help students develop their ideas. Students should then use the rest of the time to work on their piece.

## Plenary

Each group is invited to demonstrate the code they have written by executing it and playing the resulting music. This can be achieved by passing a speaker round to each group, and playing the music through the speaker rather than the headphones. Groups should introduce their composition explaining their creative journey; the remaining students should be asked to peer review, commenting constructively on what they thought worked well and why.

## Homework

Students should create a 'Cover' drawing, photograph, or picture to represent their song, ready for next lesson.
